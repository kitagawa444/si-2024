  Currently, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are widely used to transport parts in factories, requiring a high positioning accuracy of Â±10 mm for precise parts delivery. However, in environments where frequent changes occur, such as line rearrangements, the self-positioning capabilities of 2D LiDAR are often inadequate. To compensate, additional technologies, such as magnetic tape-based line detection, are commonly used. In contrast, 3D LiDAR offers significantly higher accuracy in self-positioning by utilizing information from higher, more stable areas like ceilings, which are less affected by environmental changes. This study presents the development and validation of an omni-directional cart robot system equipped with 3D LiDAR for self-position estimation and autonomous navigation, tested in a real factory environment.
